4.	The trip duration information includes rides from 5 minutes until 23 hours, being the short lapses of time, the popular ones, being 5 minutes the ride duration with more records (146,752). As we can see in the graph below, the peak of five minutes decreases until it reaches 1 hour, and from here until 23 hours, the contribution is marginal with less number or rides

5.	Following with the checkout time analysis, the total of rides is divided by gender, being the men, the ones with more bike usage. In the 5 minutes peak,  108,087 of the total of 146,752 rides were made by males, leaving only 34,151 for the females and 5,624  with gender unknown

## SUMMARY

From all the information obtained from de data of New York City Citi Bike, we can conclude that, in order to create the project in Des Maines, is necessary:

    •Have a lot of starting locations, including the most popular places on the city

    •Know that the trip duration is very short most of the times, with approximately the 80% of the rides being between 5 minutes and one hour

    •Being clear that, in all cases, the males are the vast majority of bike users

    •Know that the daytime with more rides is in the late evening, between 5 pm and 6 pm

    •It should be expected that weekends will be the days with more demand, but curiously, Thursdays and Fridays are the days with more bike usage

To finalize the analysis, we can also use visualizations that includes other months of the year and compare them with August, and also, we could use the birth year in order to identify other usage preferences.
